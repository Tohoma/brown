slide 10: "hello word" demo
    - go over calculator module
    - go over calculatorSpec
    "sample-test" - run specRunner.html
    
slide 12: timeout async testing
    "async-timeout-test"
        1. uncomment xdescribe and run "asyncAdd()"
        2. Next uncomment and test 'asyncAdd using done callback'
           Show the time when the 2 tests run in console.
           The tests are slow
           Lots of callbacks and difficult to follow
        3. Next run "asyncAdd  using jasmine.clock to make the tests faster" where the clock make setTimeout() unncessary.
           Easier to follow and no callbacks.
           
slide 16: ajax async test
    1. Show 'should invoke call $.ajax() once' to demo spy on JQuery ajax()
       Show failed test if there are 2 ajax calls.
    2. Show 'should invoke success callback if REST call is successful' and no REST call and simulate success REST call.
    3. Show 'should invoke error callback if REST call failed' and no REST call and simulate error REST call.
